# TicketPug

Brief
------

TicketPug is a proof-of-concept e-commerce site that allows users to purchase concert tickets directly from the venue hosting the event.

The aim of the project was to create a way to cut down on the amount of fees commonly associated with ticket purchases. By allowing the user to buy directly from the ticket stash allotted to venues, users can bypass some of the costlier ticket sellers. Users are able to search through the Ticketmaster API and explore events based on relevant search terms (including: artist, venue and location). Users are able to search without creating an account but if a user would like to favorite an event or make a purchase, an account will need to be created.
